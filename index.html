									<p>Marketing Campaign using customer personality analysis are done by every organizations in the 
										world. The world is evolving, and we need to evolve with it. We can’t be campaigning without 
										understanding our customers. For Example, YouTube uses the details or information they have on 
										you to suggest the channel or video you should watch to you. This research is to analyse, understand 
										and visualize the factors that affect the decision of our customers in the last campaign.</p>

									<p>For financial organisations, credit card fraud has grown to be a serious concern all around the 
										world. Because of their great accuracy and efficiency, machine learning and deep learning 
										models have been applied to detect fraudulent activity. Using a credit card fraud dataset from 
										Kaggle/UCI, investigation of the performance of six common models, including logistic 
										regression, decision tree, random forest, KNN, multilayer Perceptron, and ANN was done. The
										major goal was to find the most suitable model for detecting credit card fraud.</p>

									<p>A comprehensive study of a company’s perfect clients is called Customer personality 
										analysis. It helps a company to understand its customers better and makes it simple to 
										adapt products to meet the needs, attitudes, and affairs of different kinds of customers.Customer personality trait to advertise 
										will speed up the marketing campaign 
										and improve the company’s revenue. 
										In this work, i have my Response 
										column which makes it a labelled 
										dataset. We will also check the key 
										influencers to our response. I used three 
										supervised learning model, SVM 
										(which is Support vector machine), 
										RF (which is random forest) and DF 
										(which is Decision Tree) to train and 
										test</p>

									<p>A stroke is a medical disorder that damages the brain by rupturing blood 
										vessels. It can also happen when the brain's blood supply and other nutrients are cut off. In the World right now, 
										Stroke is the second greatest cause of death and 
										disability, according to the World Health Organization (WHO).Making use of JupyterLab, in this 
										project we used machine learning algorithms like Logistic 
										regression, Artificial Neural Network, MLP Neutral 
										Network, Random Forest and K- nearest neighbours to 
										train 5 different models for accurate prediction.From the project, Random Forest is the best for 
										predicting stroke with 94% accuracy.</p>

									<p>Purpose: To get better understanding of the company’s profit growth over the years
										Functionality: Waterfall chart display of profits for each month in a year. Button to filter each year. A mid-year total profit bar. Interactive display of the profit and month. Percentage change over each month display with a bubble. 
										Conclusion: Increase in profit every year. Percentage change tends to reduce immediately after the middle of the year bar hence more work needs to be done to increase profits in July.

									<p>This employee performance analysis using Power BI explores the data-driven evaluation of employee performance within an organization. Leveraging Power BI's robust capabilities, this project delves into various key performance indicators (KPIs) and dimensions to provide a comprehensive view of individual and team achievements. By integrating diverse data sources and creating dynamic dashboards, this analysis offers insights into productivity, efficiency, and areas for improvement. Through visualizations and interactive features, stakeholders gain actionable insights for informed decision-making, enhancing overall organizational performance and employee development.</p>
